## [Working On It]

## Introduction
`arvcc` project aims to learn `C++`, `Compiler` and `Static Analysis` in a more efficient way.

* `Front-end:`  Use Antlr to parse C++ grammar
* `IR:`  Design Three-address-Code for optimization and static analysis
* `Library:`  Accomplish some C++ feartures like smart pointers, stl
* `Back-end:` Use traditional algorithm for codegen


## Components
* googletest (build testSuite for arvcc)
* flask (visualizing collected data from arvcc's testSuite )
* antlr
* llvm  

## Build
>  Dependencies:    Clang++ 9.0.0
